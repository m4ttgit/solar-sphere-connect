## API Limits and Costs

### Zero API Costs! ðŸ’°

This integration **uses no Google APIs** and incurs **zero costs**:

- âœ… **No Geocoding API usage**
- âœ… **No Solar API usage**
- âœ… **No Maps API dependencies**
- âœ… **Direct iframe embedding only**

The integration works by embedding Google's free Sunroof tool directly, with users searching for their address within the Sunroof interface itself.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sunroof iframe not loading (X-Frame-Options)**
   - Google Sunroof blocks iframe embedding for security reasons
   - Solution: Integration now opens Sunroof in a new tab
   - This ensures full functionality while maintaining seamless UX

2. **Regional access issues**
   - Sunroof may not be available in all regions
   - Alternative tools are provided as backup options
   - NREL tools work globally

3. **Navigation not working**
   - Check data attributes are properly set on components
   - Ensure smooth scroll behavior is supported in the browser

4. **Styling issues**
   - Verify CSS classes are properly loaded
   - Check for conflicting styles

### Testing

Test the integration by:
1. **Loading the solar tools page**
2. **Clicking "Launch Google Sunroof"**
3. **Verifying iframe loads correctly**
4. **Testing navigation back to other tools**
5. **Checking responsive design on mobile**

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Required**: Ensure your site uses HTTPS in production for secure iframe embedding
2. **Content Security Policy**: Allow iframe sources from `sunroof.withgoogle.com` if you have CSP restrictions
3. **No API Keys Needed**: This integration doesn't require Google API credentials

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the integration:

1. **Caching**: Cache geocoding results to reduce API calls
2. **Offline Mode**: Fallback for when APIs are unavailable
3. **Analytics**: Track usage of Sunroof integration
4. **Customization**: More styling options for the iframe container
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience
