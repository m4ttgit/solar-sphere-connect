Sean Montey Vice President American Pallet Co. 5-Star Experience with CalSolar. When we had questions, they listened and provided answers. The entire process was smooth. Our Project-Manager Corrine was a pleasure to work with. We wanted the Best Solar available. SunPower was a little more expensive, but the 25-year warranty gives ""Peace of Mind"" and the system saves us more money long-term. If you are considering Solar, highly recommend CalSolar. Ryan Garson We chose Calsolar based on their outstanding response to my initial calls and questions. Don was very responsive and listened to my questions and concerns. More to the point, the Calsolar team delivered what I asked for in our system. I wanted the most power I could fit on our roof. Calsolar was able to give me an 11.5kw system. Beginning to end both Don and Kelly where very good about communication and keeping me updated on the status of the project. I rate companies I work with on Customer service first, then on if the product or service delivers on the promises. Last August, my PGE bill was over $700. Our solar project was completed early July. Since then, I have substantial savings on my power bill over last year. My power bill for the same period this year is $60. The immediate savings on my bill shows that CalSolar sized the project correctly, and delivered on the promises made when I first talked to them. would absolutely recommend them to anyone know!!

My electric bill has decreased tremendously. Very satisfied with my solar panels. I would do it again in a heartbeat. I am glad I worked with Chris and Centennial. John Landen I teach in an elementary school. Although I’ve seen solar in the town, my neighbors’ homes don’t have it. Chris’s daughter is one of my students, and I know he has been doing this for a while, so I asked him. He explained how solar energy works and also how people end up paying too much. He built out a design for me, set it up with the contractor, and the install was done in 8 weeks! My energy bill is practically nothing and I love showing them off! Jennifer Davis Since we’ve had our panels for a year, we’ve been overjoyed. We haven’t had any issues and have saved money. In contrast to the first firm we met with, who seemed to say anything to try to convince us to buy them, the purchasing process was simple, straightforward, and educational. Excellent overall experience and customer service. We felt much better just working with Chris directly. Thanks Chris!

KW Solar operates on market forces, not policy. The economics of KW Solar Houston solar installers are based simply on how much a solar system costs to install, and how much the market can afford to pay for it. The 30% federal tax credit, which was recently extended through 2019, is a big help to our customer base and opens the market considerably. But we stay far away from creative tax tricks, risky structures, and any gimmick that can be swept away by a congressman’s pen. Flarhgunnstow! KW Solar optimizes customer service and delivery.

PVC roofs are also selected over hot tar applied built up roofing. The IB white roof material has high solar reflectivity coatings and the roofs stay cool even at high temperatures in the atmoshphere resulting in overall reduced temperature to the property. For example, black roofs rise up to 175 &#8457; at surface temperature of just 85 &#8457;. Whereas the PVC roofs' temperature remains at about 91 &#8457;. PVC roofs are also suitable for the MidWest weather and the large commercial units in the region. The material is made using environmentally safe methods and can be recycled to reduce wastage.

Like many businesses, Quick Roofing started with one opportunity. Jeff practically begged a local homebuilder to give him a chance and allow him to roof one home. He was given that opportunity and ran with it. He had just enough money to purchase the shingles and accessories for the roof he was going to install and pay the roofers helping him install the roof. Upon completion, he was able to collect his check and was ready for the next home. He repeated this process throughout the years and was able to build a great team along the way.

The process was super easy with them. Erik Garcia We are very happy to have installed solar panels with Voltaic Solaire. They accompanied us and resolved all our questions during the installation process. Despite the PsEG process taking a long time, we now only pay between 3 and 5 dollars for the electricity bill. Even better, I receive my SRecs monthly, which covers almost 70% of my solar loan. Juliana Muñoz It was an absolutely great experience working with them. The company was always on point at explaining every step of the process until all doubts were clear. Juliana was exceptional at walking me through the process and assisting me in creating the account for the state program.
