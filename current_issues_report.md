# Current Issues Report

This report details the current issues found in `CompanyDetailPage.tsx` and `ProfilePage.tsx`.

## CompanyDetailPage.tsx

### Potential Issues and Improvements

- **Error Handling:** The `fetchSolarContactById` function within the `useQuery` hook has error handling, but the error message could be more user-friendly. Consider providing a more informative error message to the user.
- **Data Type:** The `useQuery` hook's data type is specified as `Tables<'solar_contacts'> | null`. Ensure that the `fetchSolarContactById` function always returns a value that matches this type.
- **Favorite Functionality:** The favorite functionality relies on the `user` and `company?.uuid_id` values. This has been addressed by adding conditional checks and enabling the `useQuery` hook only when these values are available.

* **Phone Number Formatting:** The `formatPhoneNumber` function has been improved to handle different phone number formats.

* **SEO:** The SEO meta tags now provide a default description if `company.description` is null.

* **Error Boundary:** The `ErrorFallback` component provides a good user experience with options to retry or return to the directory.

### Minor Issues

## ProfilePage.tsx

### Potential Issues and Improvements

- **Profile Loading:** The `loadProfile` function is now called only when the user is authenticated.
- **Favorite Companies:** The `useQuery` hook for favorite companies is now enabled only when the user is authenticated.
- **Profile Update:** The `updated_at` field in `updateProfile` is now properly formatted as a string.
- **Avatar:** A default avatar image is now provided if `user.email` is null.
- **Error Handling:** Error handling in `updateProfile` has been improved with more informative messages.

### Minor Issues

- There are no immediately obvious minor issues.

## DirectoryPage.tsx

### Minor Issues

- Property 'toLowerCase' errors in `DirectoryPage.tsx` have been fixed by adding optional chaining to ensure properties are strings before calling `toLowerCase()`.
