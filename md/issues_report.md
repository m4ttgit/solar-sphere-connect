# Issues in src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx

## TypeScript Errors

- Line 144: Property 'id' does not exist on type '{ id: any; title: any; slug: any; image: any; }[]'.
- Line 145: Property 'title' does not exist on type '{ id: any; title: any; slug: any; image: any; }[]'.
- Line 146: Property 'slug' does not exist on type '{ id: any; title: any; slug: any; image: any; }[]'.
- Line 147: Property 'image' does not exist on type '{ id: any; title: any; slug: any; image: any; }[]'.

## Possible Causes

- The `blog_posts` property in the `saved_blog_posts` table might be returning an array instead of a single object.
- The TypeScript types for the `blog_posts` property might be incorrect.
- There might be an issue with the Supabase query itself.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Investigate the structure of the `saved_blog_posts` table in the Supabase database.
- Verify the data being returned by the Supabase query.
- Review the TypeScript types for the `SavedBlogPosts` interface and ensure they match the data being returned from the query.
- Try modifying the code to handle the case where `blog_posts` is an array.
