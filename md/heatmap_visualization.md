# Heatmap Visualization Ideas and Objectives

## Overview
This document outlines the ideas and objectives for implementing a heatmap density visualization showing electricity price data across US states over time.

## Current Implementation
The project currently has a basic US heatmap component (`USHeatmap.tsx`) that displays state-level data with color coding based on electricity prices. The component uses:
- react-simple-maps for US geography rendering
- Color scaling to represent price variations
- Tooltips to show detailed information on hover

## Enhancement Objectives

### 1. Time Series Integration
- Add time dimension to visualize how electricity prices change over time
- Implement timeline slider or animation controls
- Allow users to select specific time periods for analysis

### 2. Data Density Improvements
- Enhance the color scale to better represent price variations
- Add options for different metrics (total sales, revenue, price)
- Implement multiple visualization modes (choropleth, bubble overlay, etc.)

### 3. Interactive Features
- Add state selection for detailed information display
- Implement comparison mode between different time periods
- Add data filtering options by sector (residential, commercial, industrial)

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- Add a legend explaining the color scale
- Improve tooltip information display
- Add zoom and pan capabilities for detailed regional views
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Processing Requirements
- Preprocess EIA.csv data to extract time series information
- Create aggregated datasets for different time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Implement efficient data loading to handle large datasets

### Visualization Libraries
- Continue using react-simple-maps for geography
- Consider d3.js for advanced visualization features
- Evaluate performance optimizations for smooth animations

### State Management
- Implement efficient state management for time series data
- Consider caching strategies for improved performance
- Design flexible data structures to accommodate different visualization modes

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the full EIA dataset to understand time dimension structure
2. Create prototype designs for timeline controls
3. Implement basic time series functionality
4. Add interactive features incrementally
5. Test performance with full dataset
6. Refine UI based on user feedback
